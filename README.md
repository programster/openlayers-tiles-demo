# OpenLayers Tile Demo

A project for demonstrating a basic [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) map,  
and demonstrating/filtering all the possible tile sources I can find so that one 
can easily pick the perfect tile sources for one's project.

## Usage
Simply download the index.html file and open it in your browser. There is no
need to compile/build anything. This is all just plain CSS and JS.

## Sources
A good place to find these sources is from the 
[Leaflet extras preview page](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/).
